Hysime: Hyperspectral Signal Identification by Minimum Error

VCA: Vertex Component Analysis

FCLS: Fully constrained lest square

The Hyperspectral Signal Identification by Minimum Error(Hysime) is applied to compute the total number of all endmembers of two HSIs. 
We employ the Vertex Component Analysis [47] to calculate the endmember matrix E.
